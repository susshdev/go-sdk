# Go-SDK [ALPHA]

This tool enables database functionality for any Go language application. There's no need to download additional databases when focusing on prototypes or submitting code for interviews.

Please note: Do not use this database for public or production applications. Its purpose is to swiftly launch or develop something without delving deeply into dependencies. Your core programming language is sufficient for its activation.

Data will be stored in JSON format without encryption. Therefore, refrain from developing anything containing sensitive data. In future versions, we aim to cover potential encryptions. Currently, the application is in the alpha phase, solely intended to assist fellow developers worldwide.

We'll initially develop minimum SDKs for the following languages, in this order:

- Node
- Rust
- Ruby

After completing basic SDK support, we'll progress towards enhancing all services. However, ideas or suggestions are still welcomed. Please share your thoughts on the Discord channel. This software, developed and maintained by Kushagra Varade [GitHub link], will remain free and open for everyoneâ€”a gift from one developer to all others across the globe. If you appreciate my work, kindly star the repository or support me by buying a coffee using this link.

Details on contribution guidelines and forking will be released later. Thank you for your patience.
